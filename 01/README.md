# Technical Interview Prep (pairs)

### Standard

Describe specific technologies and tools with accuracy and specificity.

### Objectives

By the end of this training, you should be able to:

* Answer technical questions with a sufficient level of depth and specificity
* Say you don't know when you don't know!

---

### Exercise

#### Format

Pair up with one other person in your class -- ideally pick a new person each time. Each time you meet with a pair for this exercise the process will be the same:

* One person will be the **interviewer** -- they'll be asking the questions and looking for key terms and descriptions

* The other person will be the **interviewee** -- they'll be answering the questions with as much specificity as possible.

Each time, the interviewer will choose three questions from one of our provided question lists to ask the interviewee and take notes throughout. _After_ the interviewee has answered all the questions, the interviewer will provide feedback.

#### As the Interviewer

Each question will have sample answers, key terms, and/or follow-up questions related to the question. Take note of what the interviewee touches on and look out specifically for vague, hand-wavy descriptions. For example:

**Question:** What is minification?

> **Not So Good Answer:**

> Minification is when we take a long CSS or JavaScript file and shorten it down to one line. It's faster and makes it harder to see what's happening on the client-side.

> **Better Answer:**

> Minification is a process by which we take a JavaScript or CSS file and purposefully remove the whitespace so that everything appears on just a few lines. The purpose of minification is to speed up time it takes to load these files. It has an added benefit of being a bit more difficult to decipher, but if we were really looking to obfuscate our code we would uglify the code as well.

If you are unsure of any of the answers the interviewee gives, make a note to look it up at the end of the session. Together, find what you think is the best answer or ask an instructor!

When you're providing feedback, do a **2x2** -- that is, focus on two positives the person exhibited and two ways in which they could improve. Specificity is best!

#### As the Interviewee

Your goal is to answer the question with as much specificity as possible! Make sure to hit relevant key terms and thoroughly describe your answer. Some tips:

* **DO** be specific and avoid vague terms wherever possible.
* **DO** rely on specific examples or make connections between other technologies to answer the question.
  * _e.g._: "$scope in Angular is similar to how scope works in regular JavaScript in that..."
* **DO** stay on topic and answer the specific question that was asked. Your answer should be no longer than a minute unless they ask follow-ups.
* On the other end, **DO NOT** offer a brief definition and stop there. Even if the question is something like "What is $scope?", give additional context and describe when you might use it.
* **DO** say you don't know if you really don't know! It is better to be honest and upfront than try and lie your way through an answer.
  * _If you sort of know the answer:_ "I don't remember everything about Encapsulation in regards to OOP but what I do know is..."
  * _If you don't know at all:_ "I'm really not sure how to answer that question. Could you maybe provide a bit more context? / Maybe there's another question I can answer better."
* **DO** smile, be kind, and seem generally like a human the company you're interviewing at would want to work with.
