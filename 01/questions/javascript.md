## Functions

### Organize code with functions

<details>
  <summary>What are the three core things a function can do?</summary>

  > return, throw, produce a side effect.

</details>
<br />

### Define what closures are and how they work in JavaScript.

<details>
  <summary>What is a Closure?</summary>

  > A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope.

</details>
<br />

### Define and call higher order functions.

<details>
  <summary>What is a higher-order-function?</summary>

  > A function that accepts a function as an argument, or returns a function as a result.

</details>
<br />

### Define and evaluate scope in JavaScript.

<details>
  <summary>What is hoisting?</summary>

  >

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What is Scope?</summary>

  > The context of our code: where variables and functions are accessible.

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What is Global Scope?</summary>

  > The top most level of scope that everything has access to.

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What is Lexical scope (or static scope)?</summary>

  > Refers to the ability for nested function to be able to access the scope of functions that contain them.

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What is an IIFE?</summary>

  > Immediately Invoked Function Expression: A function that will be defined and immediately executed.

</details>
<br />


### Distinguish between Primitive and Reference types.

<details>
  <summary>What are the data types in JavaScript?</summary>

  > Boolean, String, Undefined, Number, Null, Symbol, Object

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>List the primitive types in JavaScript.</summary>

  > Boolean, String, Number, Symbol, Null, Undefined.

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>List the reference types in JavaScript.</summary>

  > Objects - Arrays and Functions are Objects.

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between Primitive and Reference types in Javascript?</summary>

  > Primitive types use a fixed amount of memory, where as a reference type does not. Ref types like arrays are made up of references to their values, hence the name

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between == and ===?</summary>

  > == is used to compare the value of two operands where === is used to compare the value AND TYPE of two operands

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What's the difference between null and undefined?</summary>

  > `null` is an empty value, while `undefined` is something who's value hasn't been initialized.

</details>
<br />


### `this` keyword

<details>
  <summary>What does the `this` keyword refer to in JavaScript?</summary>

  > A1: The first value passed to call() or apply()
  > A2: The value that was bind()ed to the function
  > A3: The calling object
  > A4: The global scope

</details>
<br />

## Async

<details>
  <summary>What does "non-blocking" mean?</summary>

  >

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What is async in JavaScript?</summary>

  > When a function call does not immediately return a value and The program continues executing.

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What is one way to work with async code?</summary>

  > A1: Callback functions.
  > A2: Promises.
  > A3: Generator function.

</details>
<br />


### Use Promises to run sequential asynchronous operations.

<details>
  <summary>What is a Promise?</summary>

  > A promise represents the value of an asynchronous operation that is not necessarily know at the time of execution.

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What are the three states a Promise can be in?</summary>

  > Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>What method do you use to handle and error when using Promises?</summary>

  > .catch()

</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary>Why would you use a Promise?</summary>

  > Promises offer an alternative to performing asynchronous operations that are easier to reason about relative to callbacks.

</details>
<br />


## ES6 / ES2015

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between `var` and `let`?</summary>

  > var scopes a variable to the function while `let` scopes a variable to the block.

</details>
<br >

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between `const` and `let`?</summary>

  > a variable defined with `const` can not be reassigned, but one defined with `let` can.
