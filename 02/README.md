## Whiteboard Algorithm Interviewing

Whiteboard algorithm interviews are about more than just getting the "right" answer.  Employers want to see you demonstrating a careful, methodical thought process.  To succeed in whiteboarding interviews, follow these steps:

1. Always ask questions!  Always.  Start with things like:
  - What are the inputs we'll get?
  - Is this real code or pseudo-code?  If it's real, what language?
  - How should we handle null / incorrect values coming in?
  - Are you looking for any particular performance concerns?
1. Understand the outputs
  - Draw a sample input / output and double-check for understanding of the problem.  Restate the problem in your own words.
1. Break down and solve.
  - Solve for an easy input first if need be, then go back and make it more general
1. Check your work
  - Take an input, run it through your algorithm, check the value of variables at every iteration and verify that the end result is correct

Narrate the entire time.  Don't go too silent.
